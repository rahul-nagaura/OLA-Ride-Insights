# OLA Ride Insights - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involved the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze OLA's ride-sharing data. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), booking trends, and customer/driver behavior. The aim was to enable data-driven decisions for improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

The objective was to create a Power BI dashboard that allows OLA's management to:

*   Visualize ride volumes and booking patterns.
*   Analyze cancellation trends and identify contributing factors.
*   Understand revenue sources and payment method preferences.
*   Assess customer and driver ratings to identify areas for improvement.

## Steps Followed

1.  **Data Loading:** Imported the OLA ride data (Excel file) into Power BI Desktop.
2.  **Data Preprocessing (Power Query):**
    *   Cleaned the data by handling missing or incorrect values.
    *   Profiled columns to ensure data quality and consistency.
3.  **Data Transformation & KPI Creation:**
    *   Created custom columns and measures to calculate KPIs, including:
        *   Average Ride Distance
        *   Total Revenue
        *   Customer Rating
        *   Driver Rating
4.  **Dashboard Design:**
    *   Implemented slicers for dynamic filtering by region, ride type, date, etc.
    *   Created visualizations: bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and maps to represent the data effectively.
5.  **Theme & Customization:**
    *   Applied a color theme consistent with OLA's brand.
    *   Added logos and relevant images for a professional presentation.
6.  **Advanced Features:**
    *   Categorized customers based on ride frequency and total value.
    *   Implemented dynamic filters to allow users to explore specific data segments.

## Key Insights

The analysis of OLA's ride data revealed the following key insights:

1.  **Ride Volume Trends:** Higher ride volumes are observed during weekends and public holidays.
2.  **Vehicle Type Preferences:** SUVs and Hatchbacks are the most popular vehicle types among riders.
3.  **Revenue Sources:** UPI is the dominant payment method, followed by Credit Card and COD.
4.  **Cancellation Trends:** The most common reasons for cancellations are "Driver No-Show" and "Customer Canceled."
5.  **Customer & Driver Ratings:** Average customer ratings are slightly higher than driver ratings, suggesting potential areas for driver improvement programs.
